## 🕹️ How to Play
1. Run the Python script:
   ```bash

4. Use Reset Board to clear the board (scores stay).

5. Use Restart Game to reset both the board and the scores.

## 🛠️ Requirements

Python 3.x

Tkinter (usually comes pre-installed with Python)

## 📦 Installation

Clone the repository and run the script:

`git clone https://github.com/your-username/tic-tac-toe-ai.git
cd tic-tac-toe-ai
python tictactoe_ai.py`

## 📚 How the AI Works

The AI uses the Minimax algorithm:

It explores all possible moves.

It tries to maximize its own chances of winning while minimizing yours.

As a result, the AI will never lose. At best, you can force a draw.
